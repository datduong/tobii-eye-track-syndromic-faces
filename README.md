## [Paper draft](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.26.23293119v1) is now available. Dataset will be available soon.

Our main objective is to observe how clinicians and non-clinicians inspect pictures of syndromic faces. Tobii eye tracking device was used to collect visual attention heat maps of the clinicians and non-clinicians. Next, we used [intersection-over-union metric](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00536-x) to compare the visual heat maps. We also further compared how saliency maps of a deep learning classifier against human visual heat map. Our classifier is at [this other repo](https://github.com/datduong/classify-syndromic-faces). Our classifier is not state-of-the-art; the goal is to observe preliminary differences between human vs. machine.
